    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Full Of Life Food is a cooperative purchasing group that enables farmers and ranchers
to produce and distribute their amazing foods without the burden of dealing with individualized delivery and sales.</p>

<p>The founder and his family has been purchasing food from the Mountain View Farmers Market (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MVFarmersMkt">https://www.facebook.com/MVFarmersMkt</a>)  for twenty years.
Sadly, we have seen farmers leave the market due to its overhead, including recently the <a href="Full%20of%20Life%20Farm">https://www.fulloflifefarm.com/</a>.
FoLF is trying to enable these farmers and ranchers to have a better cost model by &ldquo;crowd-sourcing&rdquo; the last part of the distribution to your door.
If you want great food, just drive or walk a few minutes and pick it up!</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FullOfLifeFood/">http://www.meetup.com/FullOfLifeFood/</a> to find out where FoLF is delivering great food to you, and join in with us on a purchase.</p>
